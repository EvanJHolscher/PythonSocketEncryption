Setup:
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install pycryptodome
First Launch the Server in terminal #1
    using cmd: python server.py <port number> <key>
    example:   python server.py 1234 abcdefghnbfghasd
Then Launch the Client in terminal #2
    using cmd: python client.py <server IP> <server port> <key> 
    where <server IP> is the IP of the server, <server port> the port on 
    which the server is listening, and <key> is the 16-byte encryption key.
    example: python client.py 127.0.0.1 1234 abcdefghnbfghasd

    From the Client, input a message that will be encrypted and sent to 
    the server.

    After sending the message, observer the terminal that the server is 
    running on, it should display the correct, decoded message.
